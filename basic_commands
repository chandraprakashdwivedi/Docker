1. docker images

This will list the image id

2. Basic command to run container 

#docker run -it --name centos7 3afd47092a0e

3afd47092a0e ->this is the image id

Note: To exit from container without terminating use  (ctrl+p+q  )

3. To login again in container

#docker attach (container_id)        Note:first 3 character are enough


4.To see default docker network 

#docker network ls

To see details of particular network type and to know the ip's of container

#docker network inspect bridge

Note: Linux command to check bridges
#brctl show

5. To kill docker processes

#docker rm -v $(docker ps --filter status=created -q)

docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)

docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)

6. To execute commands directly inside docker container 

#docker exec -it centos7 bash

--------------------------------------------

Building Docker image 

For this we create a Dockerfile and run these commands 

#docker build -t image_name  .

#docker run -it --name container_name  image_id


To build multiple container in single time we use docker-compose as it is a part of continous deployment.

--------------------------------------------
Continous deployment part :

For that purpose we need to create a dockerfile to build OS image
and to automate all build also to provide particular networking and volume so that we dont need to pass
extra argument while docker run to that docker image 
we need to create yaml file using docker compose 

7. First creating Dockerfile (name of file should be same as Dockerfile)
    sample docker file:
    
    FROM centos
    RUN yum -y install httpd; yum clean all; systemctl enable httpd.service
    EXPOSE 80
    CMD ["/usr/bin/bash"]
    
 8. Sample yaml file to automate build 
    
version : '2'
services :
    apache:
        build: .
        ports:
            - "5000:80"
        volumes :
            - .:/var/www/html
           
    
    
    To run this yaml use
     
    
    #docker-compose up
    
    To run multiple container at single time
    
    #
